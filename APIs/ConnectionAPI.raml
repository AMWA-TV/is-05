  - title: Overview
    content: |
      The Connection API is exposed by NMOS Devices as a standard control interface for management of inter-device connnections.
  - title: Endpoint Discovery
    content: |
      The Connection API URL for an NMOS Device is advertised in the list of controls for that device in the Node API using type: "urn:x-nmos:control:sr-ctrl/v1.0". This information is populated into the NMOS registry via the standard registration mechanism, so it is discoverable through the Query API (see NMOS Discovery and Registration specification).
  - title: API Structure
    content: |
      The API presents two distinct interfaces. A "bulk" interface for controlling multiple senders/receivers, and a "single" interface to control single devices.

               Every transport parameter in the staged resource must be represented here.
               Any minimum/maximum constraints listed here must not allow a wider range of values than
               those allowed by the core schema. Any enum defined on this endpoint must only contain a
               subset of the values allowed for that parameter in the core schema. Similarly, pattern
               constraints must only narrow the allowed values. If the sender/receiver does
               not constrain parameters beyond what is specified in the core schema then the
               constraints in the core schema should not be duplicated on this endpoint. Where
               an "auto" mode is allowed in the core schema this mode must always be supported by
               the sender/receiver if the parameter is exposed.
               If SMPTE 2022-7 is in use, two entries are in the outer array of the resource.
               The first entry is the constraints for the primary leg.

                   The response will always contain the full set of parameters in the response schema, and all
                   supported transport parameters. For a request with an immediate activation the API should
                   only return a response once the activation has completed.
                   Note the presence of the extra `activation_time` parameter in the response. For immediate activation
                   this should be the time the activation actually occurred as an absolute TAI timestamp.
                   If no activation was requested in the PATCH `activation_time` will be set `null`.
                   When the `master_enable` parameter is false senders should not transmit any media streams.
                   For RTP senders the `rtp_enable` parameter allows for the individual disabling of SMPTE 2022-7
                   legs.

                   For scheduled activations `activation_time` should be the absolute TAI time the parameters
                   will actually transition. For absolute scheduled activations should be the same
                   as the requested time, but may differ if the sender is unable to schedule at
                   the requested time. This may be because the transition may only occur, for example,
                   at a frame boundary or end of GOP. In all other ways this response behaves identically
                   to a 200 response.

                   A resource may be unlocked by setting `mode` in `activation` to `null`, which
                   will cancel the pending activation. This may be done in the same request as a change

               chosen by the receiver. The parameter will remain set to `auto` in staged, and may be resolved to a different
               value on each subsequent activation. In cases, such as `destination_ip`, where the parameter changing unexpectedly
               at activation through re-resolution may be undesirable, care should be taken in implementation
               to manage this.

             is completed.
             When a transport file is staged the parameters in that transport file should be propagated to
             their corresponding transport parameters and the response should show these updated values.
             On activation the value of the entries in `transport_parameters` must be used to program
             the receiver, not those in the transport file directly. However while the transport file is still present
             (i.e `data` is not null) media parameters in the transport file should be applied to the RTP
             receiver. Setting `data` to null has no impact on the `transport_parameters` array, or
             any other property.
             Where a transport file has been staged the transport
             parameters in the response will reflect the new values assigned to them by the transport file.
             The transport parameters should be updated from the transport file in `data` on every PATCH
             request that includes the `data` field. Even if the value of `data` in the request
             matches the value of `data` currently stored in the API the transport parameters are still re-populated.
             In the case where the transport file and transport parameters are updated in the same PATCH request
             transport parameters specified in the request object take precedence over those in the transport file.
             In SMPTE 2022-7 operation element 0 of the `transport_params`
             array shall be the parameters applied to the primary leg, and element 1 the secondary leg.
             There shall only be one element present in `transport_params` when SMPTE 2022-7 is not in use.
             When the `master_enable` parameter is false receivers should not process any incoming streams, and
             should unsubscribe from any multicast streams they are receiving. For RTP receivers the
             `rtp_enable` parameter allows for the individual disabling of SMPTE 2022-7 legs.

                 The response will always contain the full set of parameters in the response schema, and all
                 supported transport parameters. For a request involving an immediate activation the API
                 should only return once the activation has completed.
                 Note the presence of the extra `activation_time` parameter in the response. For immediate activation
                 this should be the time the activation actually occurred as an absolute TAI timestamp.
                 If no activation was requested in the `activation_time` will be set `null`.

                 that while the request itself was acceptable it has not yet been acted upon by the receiver.
                 For scheduled activations `activation_time` should be the absolute TAI time the parameters
                 will actually transition. For absolute scheduled activations should be the same
                 as the requested time, but may differ if the receiver is unable to schedule at
                 the requested time. This may be because the transition may only occur, for example,
                 at a frame boundary or end of GOP. In all other ways this response behaves identically
                 to a 200 response.

                 A resource may be unlocked by setting `mode` in `activation` to `null`, which
                 will cancel the pending activation. This may be done in the same request as a change
                 to other parameters.

             Get active receiver parameters. On activation all instances of "auto" should be resolved
             into the actual values that will be used by the receiver. For example if a receiver has the `interface_ip`
             parameter set to `auto` in /staged then `interface_ip` in /active should show the IP address of the interface
             chosen by the receiver. The parameter will remain set to `auto` in staged, and may be resolved to a different
             value on each subsequent activation. In cases, such as `interface_ip`, where the parameter changing unexpectedly
             at activation through re-resolution may be undesirable, care should be taken in implementation
             to manage this.

# APIs: Client Side Implementation Notes

## Conforming to Schemas

When interacting with a Connection Management API, a client may assume the presence of a core set of attributes for each defined transport type. Other parameters may be defined by the specification, but are optional for implementations given that they may or may not implement a particular feature. Presence of these attributes in an implementation cannot be assumed and must be identified via the '/constraints' resource of a running Device.

For core attributes, individual APIs may still constrain their permitted values to a particular range or enumeration, so parsing the constraints is still recommended.
